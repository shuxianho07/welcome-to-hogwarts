##  Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Structure | HTML5 (semantic markup) |
| Styling | Vanilla CSS (custom design tokens, keyframe animations, responsive layout) |
| Logic | Vanilla JavaScript ES6+ (no frameworks or bundlers) |
| Fonts | Google Fonts — Cinzel (serif headings), Caveat (handwriting), Patrick Hand (cursive body), Outfit (sans-serif) |
| Rendering | DOM-based rendering (2D sprite animation via Canvas for transparency processing) |
| PDF Embedding | HTML5 `<iframe>` for resume PDF viewer |

The entire game engine is hand-rolled — no libraries, no build tools. All sprite processing (white background removal) is done at runtime via the Canvas 2D API.

##  Running Locally

No build step required. Just open the file in a browser:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/shuxianho07/welcome-to-hogwarts.git
cd welcome-to-hogwarts

# Open in browser (any of the following)
# Option 1: Double-click index.html
# Option 2: Use a local dev server (recommended to avoid CORS issues with assets)
npx http-server -p 8000
# or
python -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
```

> **Note:** Opening `index.html` directly with `file://` may block sprite loading in some browsers due to CORS restrictions. Using a local server is recommended.

##  Design System

The portfolio features an **organic scrapbook aesthetic** inspired by the Hogwarts universe:

- **Color Palette:**
  - Parchment: `#E8DCC4` (primary background)
  - Dark Brown: `#3e352b` (text / borders)
  - Red Ink: `#8c2a2a` (headings / accents)
  - Gold: `#d4a867` (highlights / links)
  
- **Typography:**
  - Caveat (handwritten style) for titles
  - Patrick Hand (cursive) for body text
  - Cinzel (serif) for game UI
  
- **Elements:**
  - Organic "wonky" borders via irregular `border-radius`
  - Dot texture via CSS `radial-gradient`
  - Hand-drawn shadow effects with offset `box-shadow`
  - Hover animations and smooth transitions
